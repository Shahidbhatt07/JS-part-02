In this series we will cover
***. How javascript works
it is completed in 2 phases
1. compilation phase

 > compilation phase is comprised of 3 stages:-
    1) Tokenizing: in this phase, code is broken down into small chunks of code c/d as tokens
    2) Parsing: in this phase, these tokens are visualised and a abstract syntax tree(AST) is formed of this code and this tree helps in forming executable format of code.
    3) code generation

    Note: During compilation, 2 things are taken into consideration, 1) all errors are checked 2) Determining appropriate scope for variables

 2. code execution phase
when code is executed, a phase is created called as Execution phase
    There are two types of execution phases: 1) Global execution phase and 2) Function execution phase
  Note: Both these phases work same, but the only difference is that function execution phase is associated with functions.

  GEC of FEC both is completed in 2 phases:
  1. Memory creation phase (M.C.P) : in this phase, by default window object and this keyword are present. variables are provided memory.
            note: in case of "Var", variable initially it is assigned the value of "undefined".
            and in case of let and const, variables are assigned the value of "uninitialised"

  2. Code execution phase (C.E.P) : in this phase, line by line code is executed


Hoisting: To call a function or console a varibale before declaring it is called hoisting.
Urdu version: variables code ke execution hone se pehle memory mai add hoke available hona, isko hoisting kehte hai.

Array like objects: those objects which have properties of accessing by index property and have length property.

TDZ: Temporal dead zone: It is a time in which a variable becomes initialised when it was uninitialised.
            let
            uninitialised--------------------------------------> initialised
                                        TDZ
